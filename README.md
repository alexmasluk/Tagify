# Tagify

A tag-oriented approach to managing Spotify playlists.

When you start the app, it scans your playlists and applies three tags to them:
* The name of the playlist
* Whether or not the song contains Explicit content, according to Spotify, indicated by the tag "nsfw"
* The song's year, according to Spotify (sometimes refers to the date the song was added to Spotify's library rather than actual release date)

You can then create additional playlists based on including and excluding tags. Suppose you have a Rock playlist and a Pop playlist. You can enter "2018 Pop Rock -nsfw" and generate a new playlist consisting of all the songs from those two playlists released in 2018, but with all explicit content removed. 

You can also apply aliases to playlists. So if your "rock" playlist is called "riff magick, daddyo!" you can give it a "rock" alias and refer to it that way, when managing your tagged lists.

You can also make up additional tags and apply them to songs as desired.
